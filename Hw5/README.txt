Programs:
pig: reads English text from stdin and prints out a Pig Latin translation.
unpig: reads Pig Latin text from stdin and prints out an English translation. If the word is not in Pig Latin, it is left unchanged. When a Pig Latin word ends in 'ay', one consonant is moved to the beginning.
ElmerFudd: reads English text from stdin and prints out Elmer Fudd translation.

unpig.c: source code for unpig. 
pig.c: source code for pig
ElmerFudd.c: source code for ElmerFudd

Only bug: When a ';' is in the text, the program believes that the subsequent letters are a command (???)

We would like to use one of our late days for this lab.

We have adhered to the Honor Code in this assignment.
